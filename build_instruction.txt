TianoCore UDK2015 Build Instructions for Intel(R) PRO/1000 Open Source Driver
Copyright 2016, Intel Corporation, All Rights Reserved


PREBUILD INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------
The files included in this source package allow the PRO/1000 UEFI UNDI driver binary
to be built as part of the Tiano Core UDK2015 source tree. Before building the
driver you must download the Tiano Core UDK2015 release source from
www.tianocore.org and follow the instructions in Release Notes to build the
tree for your target architecture.

Note: Extract the contents of BaseTools(Windows).zip directly to the directory
with the package folders.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
These instructions use the Microsoft Visual Studio 12 (2013) compiler tools.
Follow the below steps to integrate the PRO/1000 UEFI UNDI driver into the UDK2015 source tree.

1. Extract the contents of GigUndiDxe.zip into the UDK2015 root/workspace 
directory so that "IntelUndiPkg" is placed among the other "Pkg" folders.

2. Change to the root directory and run edksetup.bat to set up a workspace
environment for UDK2015.

3. Provide architecture, toolchain, package to build, module and build type as
parameters to build the UEFI driver executable. Supported architectures are: 
A32, X64 and IPF (Itanium).
For example, to build for the IA32 architecture:

build -a IA32 -t VS2013x86 -p IntelUndiPkg\IntelGigUndiPkg.dsc -m IntelUndiPkg\GigUndiDxe\GigUndiDxe.inf -b RELEASE

Important: Before performing an Itanium build, review the ITANIUM SPECIFIC
section.

4. The resultant .efi image is located in:
\Build\IntelUndiPkg\RELEASE_{TOOLCHAIN}\{ARCHITECTURE}\GigUndiDxe.efi
depending on target toolchain and architecture.


ITANIUM SPECIFIC
----------------
The tools_def.txt file, which defines available toolchains, uses an old WINDDK
version (3790.1830). This version is no longer available from official sources.
Because of this, you will have to modify the tools_def defines.
The oldest available version is "Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0" which can be
downloaded from Microsoft's website. After you install the WDK, replace the
following tools_def (located in \Conf\ folder) defines with:
  DEFINE WINDDK_BIN16 = C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\bin\bin16
  DEFINE WINDDK_BIN32 = C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\bin\x86
  DEFINE WINDDK_BINX64 = C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\bin\x86\amd64
  DEFINE WINDDK_BIN64 = C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\bin\x86\ia64

lib.exe does not exist in this toolchain version, its functionality is included
in link.exe.
Replace this line:
  *_DDK3790_IPF_SLINK_PATH = DEF(WINDDK_BIN64)\lib.exe
with:
  *_DDK3790_IPF_SLINK_PATH = DEF(WINDDK_BIN64)\link.exe /lib
Then create Itanium build by issuing:
build -a IPF -t DDK3790 -p IntelUndiPkg\IntelGigUndiPkg.dsc -m IntelUndiPkg\GigUndiDxe\GigUndiDxe.inf -b RELEASE
